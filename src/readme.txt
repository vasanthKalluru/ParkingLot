Hi,
In the class only the basic skeleton of repos, services and controllers is explained.
Some basics of initialization using main class is also there.
But then there is no data in the hashmap that have been created so far.

Need to be done:
- Create data in the repos dynamically i.e. give the appropriate methods in the repos and use them to create data in the hash map.
- Use the data present in the repos and get the ticket in the main class.
